# Lessons in the fundamentals of artificial neural networks

This repository contains a collection of smaller projects and articles aimed at improving the understanding  of artificial neural networks. Those articles are primary focused on teaching. Some of the methods are unconventional and not suited for use in production. My aim is to peel back some of the outer layers of neural networks and look beneath them. This is great for learning, but I recommend using the abstraction established frameworks provide when writing production quality code.

So please use these resources as they were intended to - as a source of information and guidance to sharpen your understanding of neural networks. Keep on learning and enjoy the process!
